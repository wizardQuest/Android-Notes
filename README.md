## 📖 Study Strategy

### 1. **Active Reading Approach**

- ✅ **Don't just read** - Write code examples as you go
- ✅ **Take notes** - Summarize key concepts in your own words
- ✅ **Practice immediately** - After each section, try to explain it to someone (or yourself)
- ✅ **Code along** - Create small projects to test concepts

### 2. **Priority Order (If Time is Limited)**

1. **Must Know** (Core for any Android interview):
   - Android.md (Sections 1-3, 13)
   - coroutines/Coroutines.md
   - dependency-injection/Dagger.md (Hilt section)

2. **Should Know** (Important for senior roles):
   - Kotlin.md (Advanced sections)
   - Android.md (System Design section)
   - Gradle.md

3. **Nice to Know** (For lead/architect roles):
   - Advanced Kotlin topics
   - Performance deep dives
   - Build system optimization

### 3. **Practice Strategy**

- **Day 1-7**: Focus on reading and understanding
- **Day 8-10**: Practice coding examples
- **Day 11-12**: Solve tricky questions
- **Day 13-14**: Mock interviews and final review
